# The-Helper

Welcome to The Helper, The Helper is a batch file (which might turn into a .exe file) that I made which does alot of stuff for you, like opening browsers, websites, midi players, and it also has HelpFul Kits in which if you reset your computer, it opens a setup file to setup your computer in a few steps (installing a browser, etc.), and it has tools being developed still, like Soundfont Dowloader (SD) and Midi Downloader (MD), these are added in this version (1.3.54) of The Helper. You you can also shutdown, restart, hibernate, and log off, The Helper (in development) also has some settings which are still being developed by me, and "one last option" which is exit, in which exits The Helper

# Warnings for 2 operating systems

I have made The Helper before on Windows XP and it loaded the batch, but when I saw what it looked like, it was terrible because some of the things were not what they were supposed to look like. I am also not sure what this program would look like in Windows 2000 (I could do a VirtualBox of it and see what The Helper would look like)

And I might take off Windows 2000 and Windows XP because of what I mentioned above...
