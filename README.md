# The-Helper

Welcome to The Helper, The Helper is a batch file (which might turn into a .exe file) that I made which does alot of stuff for you, like opening browsers, websites, midi players, and it also has HelpFul Kits in which if you reset your computer, it opens a setup file to setup your computer in a few steps (installing a browser, etc.), and it has tools being developed still, like Soundfont Dowloader (SD) and Midi Downloader (MD), these are added in this version (1.3.54) of The Helper. You you can also shutdown, restart, hibernate, and log off, The Helper (in development) also has some settings which are still being developed by me, and "one last option" which is exit, in which exits The Helper

# A Notice

I question you, are you sure you want stuff to be downloaded or installed onto your pc when you launch this?
(this gives me an idea to release an update after so long)

By the way, if you dont want stuff to be downloaded or installed onto your pc, then simply dont download The Helper, if you do, then you can download The Helper.

Another way to bypass The Helper downloading or installing stuff onto your HOST pc, is to create a Virtual Machine of some sort and use The Helper on there, if you dont feel like doing that, then again, simply dont download The Helper.

:)
