# The-Helper

Welcome to The Helper, The Helper is a batch file (which might turn into a .exe file) that I made which does alot of stuff for you, like opening browsers, websites, midi players, and it also has HelpFul Kits in which if you reset your computer, it opens a setup file to setup your computer in a few steps (installing a browser, etc.), and it has tools being developed still, like Soundfont Dowloader (SD) and Midi Downloader (MD), these are added in this version (1.3.54) of The Helper. You you can also shutdown, restart, hibernate, and log off, The Helper (in development) also has some settings which are still being developed by me, and "one last option" which is exit, in which exits The Helper
